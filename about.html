		I received a notifaction two weeks ago congratulating me on my 11th year on Facebook. I am currently 22 years old, which means I have had half of my entire life online. What a scary thought. Adolescence is awkward enough and Facebook allows us to immortalize this. 
 <br><br>
		I downloaded all my Facebook data since the inception of my account and opened pandora's box. All the comments I had ever made, Apple photobooth pictures taken, and worst of all, my entire search history were all neatly logged on multiple json files. Among these files, I found a log of all the comments I had made on groups I was a a part of since 2011. Scrolling through comment after comment, through words I had clearly said once but had since forgotten, was a dizzying experience. I sought to recreate this experience with the spiral visualization. The site allows the user to view the comments chronologically, starting from the center of the circle outwards. Each bar represents one comment, with different colors corresponding to different groups the comment was posted in. The collection of these bars aptly formed what I think resembles an iris, which is a fitting symbol for the idea of visibility, remembrance, and immortalization through digital media. 
 <br><br>

		It was an interesting experience for me personally to see the evolution of how I spoke to others (with the main difference being the ommission of the word "dude" as time progressed and reason caught up), the groups I had been active on acting in parallel with my moving from high school to university, and the frequency of activity at different points (with posts less frequent during study away in 2017 and in summer months).
 <br><br>

		I used the d3.js library for this project. I had initially planned to create force directed visualization as in this <a href=  "http://www.redotheweb.com/CodeFlower/"> example</a> but encountered challanges in formatting the data to fit into the node and link structure the code required. I tried to find visualizations that would allow me to group data points without having to create links between them and chose this <a href=  "https://bl.ocks.org/arpitnarechania/027e163073864ef2ac4ceb5c2c0bf616"> example</a> to draw from. 
 <br><br>
		Moving forward, I would like to collect data from willing friends to compare our social media activity. Another option could be visualizing other parts of my online profile-- perhaps the pages I have liked or the private messsages I have sent.
